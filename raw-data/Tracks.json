Similarly, I can't remember if Into the valley or Suspect device by Stiff Little Fingers was the first single I ever bought! The Skids have reformed in various line-ups and played several gigs since 2002, the most recent being on 6th March 2010 at the Alhambra Theatre, Dunfermline as part of the 2010 Fifer Festival, which is available on DVD and well worth a look!<\/p>"},

This song along with A message to you Rudy formed the doubled A-sided (remember them?) second single reaching number 10 in the charts and features Chrissie Hynde on backing vocals. It contains one of my favourite song lines ever \"I won't dance in a club like this, all the girls are slags and the beer tastes just like piss!\" Brilliant!<\/p>"},

Former Jam bassist Bruce Foxton (see track 17) played with Stiff Little Fingers for 15 years between 1991 and 2006.

There is some debate about whether the lyric refers to \"clitares\" (a French bathing costume) or \"clitoris\" with the general feeling being it was deliberately chosen to cover both!<\/p>"},
